DarkerGreen
===========

CM11Theme-DarkerGreen a complete light theme with darker and lighter green accents.

It uses mostly stock images, those images included in the theme are there for a reason, either I needed to color them for visibility, color them for accent, or satisfy a style attribute.
All system apps have been made to be light themed, I didn't get to absolutely everything(package installer wouldn't cooperate).

BE SURE TO DELETE THE gitattributes file, I'm new to github and dont know how to move or remove it from the template.
